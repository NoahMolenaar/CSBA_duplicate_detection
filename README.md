# CSBA_duplicate_detection

In this paper, I have worked with Jens Peek (542716jp) as programming buddy. We worked in R and created different R scripts for in-sample evaluation and out-of-sample evaluation.
The in-sample script needs to be run first, thereafter the out-of-sample script can be run. The latter is quite similar to the former, but uses the results from the former as input.
We are particularly interested in the results of the out-of-sample script.
